Algorithm Performance
=====================

CuGraph provides unmatched speed with familiar APIs that match the most popular PyData libraries.
Built on state-of-the-art foundations like NVIDIA CUDA and Apache Arrow, cuGraph algorithms unlock 
the speed of GPUs with code you already know. The exact speed-up depend on the GPU and other
resources available but here are some examples of algorithm run times with commodity GPU's.
