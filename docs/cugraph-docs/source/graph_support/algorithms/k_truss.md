# K Truss

The k-truss of a graph is a subgraph where each edge is part of at least (kâˆ’2) triangles [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_graph). K-trusses are used for finding tightly knit groups of vertices in a graph. A k-truss is a relaxation of [k-clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)) in the graph. Finding cliques is computationally demanding and finding the maximal k-clique is known to be NP-Hard

This algorithm computes the k-truss of a graph. A K-Truss is a relaxed cliques where every vertex is supported by at least a k-2 [triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_graph).


## Definition
The k-truss in a graph is the largest subgraph of size k nodes, where there are k-2 triangles with edges in the subgraph.


## When to use K-Truss
* for finding dense subgraphs in a large graph
* as part of link prediction since undetected edges are common in dense communities.
* 

## When not to use K-Truss


## How computationally expensive is it?
