# K Truss

The k-truss of a graph is the subgraph where each edge is part of at least (kâˆ’2) [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_graph). K-trusses are used for finding tightly knit groups of vertices in a graph. A k-truss is a relaxation of [k-clique discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)) in the graph.

This algorithm computes the k-truss of a graph. A K-Truss is a relaxed cliques where every vertex is supported by at least a k-2 number of [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_graph).


## Definition
The k-truss in a graph is the largest subgraph of size k nodes, where there are k-2 triangles with edges in the subgraph.


## When to use K-Truss
* for finding dense subgraphs in a large graph
* as part of link prediction since undetected edges are common in dense communities.

## When not to use K-Truss
* Sparse graphs which don't contain many triangles
* When searching for overlapping communities
* When you are looking for paths in the graph rather than communities

## How computationally expensive is it?
K-Truss is most commonly compared to k-clique in terms of cost. This is mostly because k-clique becomes quickly unusable at scale.

The Big-O cost for k-truss is $\mathcal{O}(m^{1.5})$ where m is the number of edges.

By comparison, finding the largest clique in the graph has a Big-O cost of $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$
